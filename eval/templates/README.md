# Template registry

> **GENERATED — do not edit by hand.** Produced by `build_registry.py` from each template's YAML (`*.yaml`) and its ground-truth query frontmatter (`ground_truth/*.rq`).
> Regenerate: `uv run --extra produce python eval/templates/build_registry.py` (add `--verify` to re-check answers against GraphDB).

The `.rq` frontmatter is authoritative for the committed seed and answer; this table copies it. Templates are ordered by `type_id` (taxonomy order).

| `type_id` | Template | Question | Committed seed | Answer |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `02_1hop_factoid` | `genes_expressed_in_anatomy` | Which genes are expressed in {anatomy}? | nasal cavity (`uberon:0001707`) | 4 results |
| `03_2hop_traversal` | `genes_associated_with_compound_treated_diseases` | Which genes are associated with the diseases that {compound} treats? | Tiludronate (`db:DB01133`) | 16 results |
| `04_3plus_hop_traversal` | `symptoms_of_pharmacologic_class_treated_diseases` | Which symptoms are presented by the diseases treated by compounds in the {drug_class} class? | Sulfonylurea Compounds (`ndfrt:N0000008054`) | 18 results |
| `05_aggregative` | `count_of_side_effects_caused_by_compound` | How many side effects does {compound} cause? | Streptomycin (`db:DB01082`) | `27` |
